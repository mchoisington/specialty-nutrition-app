# Data review queue

Items the build agents flagged for a human decision. Nothing here blocks use of the app; each is a place where a judgment was made conservatively and a reviewer (Mary, or a family member's clinician) may want to confirm or relax it. Where a file holds the detail, the field name is given.

## Rules (data/conditions.json)

- **Inferred conflicts.** Phase 1 names the sodium conflict for POTS against hypertension and CKD. The same clinician-resolution conflict was added for POTS against heart failure, dialysis, and kidney stones (all sodium under 2,300 mg), and protein conflicts for CKD against cancer treatment and osteoporosis. Each carries `"inferred": true`. Remove any you consider over-reach.
- **IBD flare mode expiry** is 14 days. That is an app default for the check-in prompt, not a clinical number (`modes[].expires_days`).
- **Restriction-load threshold** is three simultaneous eliminations (`eds-restriction-load.threshold`).
- **Engine wiring edits** made after the content was written are listed in the file's top-level `notes` and in each module's `review_note`: variants for higher-protein-older-adult, cancer-nutrition and low-carb-ketogenic; `applies_if` on osteoporosis calcium and vitamin D and on heart-failure fluid; the `flags` catalog; two rules (`wm-deficit`, `veg-b12`) reclassified from numeric targets to habits because the app cannot measure them.
- **Eating-disorder screen wording** in `src/engine/screen.js` is a placeholder. Mary writes the final language.

## Ingredient dictionary (data/dictionaries.json)

- `unsure` (42 terms): terms considered for a tag and left out. Mostly FODMAP portion cases that exist only in the Monash app, polyols without a tag, sauces that sometimes contain gluten, and histamine "liberator" foods.
- `not_tagged` (18): recognized terms deliberately left without tags.
- **Tree-nut list.** FDA's January 2025 allergen guidance revised which tree nuts count as major allergens (coconut removed, chestnut likely). Coconut and chestnut keep the tree-nut tag here on purpose. VERIFY before relaxing.
- **Trigger tags** (chocolate, citrus, tomato, spicy, carbonated, mint, msg, aspartame) exist only to drive optional toggles for GERD and migraine. They are never default exclusions.
- **basic-ingredient** marks pantry words as recognized so they are not reported as unknown. It carries no restriction meaning.

## Food database (data/foods.json, tools/food-selection.json)

- `tag_review` (137 entries across 97 foods): tags the importer was unsure about (FODMAP portion cases, mid-tier mercury fish, histamine on cultured dairy, phosphate additives in processed meats, coconut).
- **fill_from judgment calls.** 161 Foundation foods fill missing nutrients from a matched SR Legacy record; every filled key is listed under `fill_from.keys`. The matches a reviewer should look at (each has a `fill_note` naming the alternative): 2646174 chuck roast, 2646173 top round, 2646168 pork loin, 746781 chorizo, 2261420 almond flour, 2261421 oat flour, 2346397 steel-cut oats, 2003587 spelt flour, 2684443 shrimp, 2684446 pasteurized crab, 2647439 American cheese singles, 2259795 parmesan, 749420 bacon, 2644285 / 2644287 / 2644292 canned beans, and the tomato substitutions 321360, 1999634, 333281, 2685578.
- **Fiber method.** Classic total dietary fiber (nutrient 1079) is used everywhere it exists, from the primary record or its fill record. The AOAC 2011.25 value (2033) counts resistant starch and runs higher on every food that has both; it is used only as a labeled last resort and currently applies to no food.
- **Remaining nulls:** fiber for oat milk, farro, shrimp; saturated fat for shiitake and a handful of SR Legacy items. `added_sugar_g` is null for every food; USDA does not publish it.
- **No USDA portion** for 135 foods (100 g only). Recipes give grams directly, so this only affects the food search display and grocery quantities.

## Recipes (data/recipes.json)

- Ingredient substitutions made because the food was not in the database: garlic-infused oil omitted; whole-wheat tortillas as flour or corn; breadcrumbs as rolled oats; Dijon as yellow mustard; rice vinegar as cider vinegar; low-sodium vegetable broth as regular broth cut with water.
- Sodium tips exist on every recipe that uses soy sauce, fish sauce, canned goods, or rotisserie chicken.

## Support resources (src/engine/screen.js)

- The National Alliance for Eating Disorders is named without a phone number. Confirm the current helpline number before family use.
