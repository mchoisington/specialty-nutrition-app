    ${uiPageHeader('How this app decides', 'The rules the engine follows, and where they come from.', `<a class="btn small" href="#/learn">${uiIcon('book')}All topics</a>`)}
    <article class="article">
      <h2>Two tiers of rules</h2>
      <p>Tier 1 rules come straight from published guidelines and apply to everyone with the condition: sodium under 2,300 mg a day for high blood pressure, for example. Tier 2 rules need a number that only your doctor or dietitian can set: a protein target in kidney disease, a fluid limit in advanced heart failure. The app knows the published range for a Tier 2 rule, shows it, and refuses to pick a value. Until you enter that number, that module runs on its Tier 1 rules only and the plan says so.</p>
      <h2>Hard conflicts stop the number, not the plan</h2>
      <p>Some conditions give opposite advice. DASH is potassium-rich; kidney disease limits potassium. When two of your modules disagree like that, the app generates no number for that nutrient, shows the conflict, and asks for a number from your doctor or dietitian. Everything else in the plan still builds.</p>
      <h2>Allergens are absolute</h2>
      <p>A confirmed food allergy is a hard exclusion. No preference, mode, phase, or acknowledgment overrides it. A recipe with a matching ingredient is never scheduled, and a checked food fails.</p>
      <h2>Unknown is not safe</h2>
      <p>The ingredient checker matches exact terms from a maintained dictionary. It does not guess. Anything it does not recognize is reported as "not recognized" and, when you have an allergen on file, that alone makes the verdict a caution. Terms like "natural flavors" or "spices" that can hide an allergen are flagged separately.</p>
      <h2>No language model in the safety path</h2>
      <p>Nothing that decides whether a food passes, what a number is, or what a rule says uses a language model. Safety decisions come from data files a person can read: the rules, the dictionary, the food table. Numbers are summed from grams; they never come from text. The one optional helper, on the Preferences step, can draft a description of a diet you name; it is labeled as general knowledge, it never saves anything by itself, and the rules it proposes are soft preferences you confirm.</p>
      <h2>Diets you define yourself</h2>
      <p>A diet that is not on the list can be added by name. It becomes a module marked "Defined by you" with soft rules and no evidence rating. It never loosens an allergen or a condition rule.</p>
      <h2>Nutrient data</h2>
      <p>Every food is a USDA FoodData Central record (SR Legacy or Foundation Foods), keyed by its FDC ID. The import script writes the food table; nobody edits numbers by hand. Where USDA has no value for a nutrient (added sugar, for example), the app shows "no data" rather than an estimate.</p>
      <h2>FODMAP tags are not Monash-verified</h2>
      <p>The low FODMAP module is built from published studies and USDA data. It does not use the Monash University database, and its tags carry a "not Monash-verified" notice. Portion notes matter: many foods are low FODMAP in a small serving and high in a large one.</p>
      <h2>Elimination phases</h2>
      <p>Elimination phases (low FODMAP, low histamine) run until you change them. The protocol's usual length is shown on the Plan screen, and you can ask the app to check in after a set number of weeks and ask whether to move on to reintroduction or keep going. A long elimination narrows what you eat, so the check-in is worth setting.</p>
      <h2>Stacked restrictions</h2>
      <p>Running several diets that each cut out whole food groups at the same time makes it harder to get enough fiber, calcium, protein, and variety. When three or more are active at once the plan says so and suggests running one at a time where you can.</p>
      <h2>Where this comes from</h2>
      <p>The evidence review behind every module is <strong>docs/PHASE-1-evidence-and-regulatory-foundation.md</strong> (Phase 1: Evidence and Regulatory Foundation), and the build decisions are in <strong>docs/PHASE-2-prd-and-architecture.md</strong>. Items marked VERIFY in Phase 1 are shown with that flag in the app until they are cleared in docs/VERIFY-log.md.</p>
      <p class="small muted">This app is for general wellness and education. It does not diagnose or treat any condition. Any medical targets, like a sodium or protein limit, come from your doctor or dietitian, never from the app.</p>

The Parent Club site itself carries no licence statement. The recipe text is Crown copyright and is used here on the assumption that the same licence applies; that assumption is recorded on every record and on this page rather than hidden. No photographs were taken.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Source: Parent Club recipes, ${ext('https://www.parentclub.scot/recipes')}, one listing page and one page per recipe.</li>

        <li>Recipe ids: <code>pcs-&lt;page-slug&gt;</code>; <code>source_url</code> is the page the text came from. Importer: <code>tools/import-parentclub.mjs</code>.</li>
        <li>Nutrition data: each page publishes a "Detailed nutritional information" table per 100 g and per serving: energy, protein, total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, total sugars, NSP fibre, <strong>sodium in mg</strong>, and salt. The per-serving column is stored as-is in <code>nutrition_per_serving</code> with <code>nutrition_source: "parentclub-scot"</code>; the serving weight is kept as <code>serving_grams</code>. A blank cell is left out, not guessed: every page leaves total fat blank, so <code>fat_g</code> is absent for this collection and only saturated fat is known. Fibre is by the NSP method, which reads lower than the AOAC method used by USDA foods. Where a page publishes sodium and salt that disagree by more than a quarter, the importer logs it and keeps the published sodium.</li>
        <li>Ingredient lines keep the site's gram weights in the text, for example "2 Tablespoons (30g) Tomato Puree", so the grocery list and any later food linking can use them.</li>
        <li>Meal slots come from the site's category (breakfast, lunch, dinner, starter, snack, dessert) and the title, then pass through the same component and breakfast checks as every other collection.</li>

      <h2>How the app uses these recipes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ingredients are display-only (<code>{ "display": "..." }</code>, no <code>food</code> link, no grams). The dictionary tags ingredient text at run time for allergen and diet checks, and anything unrecognised is reported as such, never treated as safe.</li>
        <li>NHS and Parent Club recipes show the stored per-serving nutrition (<code>recipeTotals</code> in <code>src/engine/nutrition.js</code> uses it when a recipe has <code>nutrition_source</code> and <code>nutrition_per_serving</code> and no linked foods).</li>
        <li>Wikibooks recipes show no nutrition until ingredients are linked in the editor.</li>
        <li><code>tags</code> is empty on every imported recipe because the tag vocabulary is controlled; tags are added by hand or by the dictionary at run time.</li>
        <li>Recipes you write yourself ("Mine") and ingredient links you add are stored on this device in your profile, never in the data files.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Peace Meal recipes</h2>
      <p>The ${uiFmtNum(c.peaceMeal)} recipes written for Peace Meal link every ingredient to a USDA FoodData Central record, so their nutrients are summed from <code>foods.json</code> by grams. They carry no outside licence.</p>
